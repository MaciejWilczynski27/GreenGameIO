In this Spring Boot project I was responsible for implementing beckend side of the friend module, which allows users to communicate with each other via real time chat
- users can manange they friend list, create group chats and so on.
- all the chat history is kept on a different DBMS, which is MongoDB(Default data source for the rest of this app is PostgreSQL).
- the messages are sent via websocket.
