In this Spring Boot project I was responsible for implementing beckend side of the friend module, which allows users to communicate with each other via real time chat,
they can manange they friend list, create group chats and so on. 
On top of that all the chat history is kept on a different DBMS, which is MongoDB(Default data source for the rest of this app is PostgreSQL).
The messages are sent via websocket.
